## Determine volunteers for note taking (1m, Ivan)

- Uri

## Requirements for becoming a maintainer (15m, Uri)

- Communication with a new contributers are hard, Ivan is worried that a lot of contributors don't want to learn about the project but just push a one time change
- Ivan says we shouldn't change to much on a single PR
- Ivan says there are almost no bugs today. So we need to be careful with large changes.
- Ivan says also for history we need small PRs
- Ivan says we need to form a core team
- Ivan says he has limited amount of time for reviews
- Ivan says he has an open task from before to create a contribution guide
- Uri says The Guild, as a group of experienced developers in both GraphQL, Javascript and open source are ready to dedicate continuous time, for long term, for free, for the graphql-js project
- Uri says we need to start with a single person to nominate, as otherwise Ivan would spread his time with too many people
- Once we'll have a person in mind, it would be easier to think about an actual plan and also to track if that plan is progressing well and if not why
- So how should we choose that person and what do we need that person to prove in order to become a maintainer?
- Marcelo added that he agrees with Ivan about keeping PRs small, but also added that this is usually a symptom of not having a clear roadmap and that he wants to contribute as well and the lack of roadmap currently holds him back
- Ivan says it's not fair to choose a single person because it would put pressure on that person and it's open source and free work
- ACTION - Ivan says he should have an SLA for responding to PRs, issues and comments
- Uri says there are two main things here: 1. How can we get mroe PRs in? (or how can we optimize Ivan's time) Which all of Ivan's suggestions are agreed by all. We would do that immediately and hope it would help getting our current changes in. But the second point whihc is not less important is - How can we get more "Ivans" in as contributors and increase the amount of reviewers. 
- Ivan says if a person is following the guidelines, invested and is ready to commmit continuting for long term (2 months according to Ivan), he is happy to introduce new maintainers.
- But it needs to be confirmed also with the GraphQL Foundation
- Uri said it should be less about anticipating what will happen in the future but more about monitoring the maintainers and if they stop being active, just to remove them. That way we won't block maintainers but still get the high quality we want
- ACTION - Corrently there are 60 people from Facebook that should be removed
- Ivan also says we are just starting to we could just do a manual and simple process
- ACTION - Ivan said he will create a contribution guide on the following day and prepare the first iteration this week.

## Typescript Migration plan (15m, Uri)

- Ivan said the first version of the migration should be clear to people that are not Typescript developers because graphql-js is also a reference implmenentation
- Dotan said there should be some kind of balance, but it might also be problematic if we limit the usage of the language features too much.
- Ivan suggested to postpone this discussion after the first migration. So not adding new features but just convert to Typescript. 
- Ivan said he thinks Typescript conversion should go into 16.x.x version so we could break some things like Typescript version support
- ACTION - Ivan to create detailed issues and a public roadmap for everything that's needed from his point of view for the Typescript migration
- ACTION - Ivan asked for help with maintaining flow types after the migration.  Dotan said he will take it on himself.
- Ivan wants to drop some polyfills on 16.x.x

## Progress and next steps for @defer and @stream related PR (and Async Iterables) (15m, Rob)

- Ivan suggested to release an experimental release from the branch and to keep it up to date, so people could start trying it out and giving feedback
- Merge to master after we release 16.0.0-alpha.0

## Other things

- Ivan to schedule the next graphql-js working group meeting
- Ivan to promote Marcelo in triaging permissions role
