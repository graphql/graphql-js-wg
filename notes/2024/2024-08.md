**Watch the replays:**
[GraphQL.js Working Group Meetings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP1igyLx8foHghwopNuQM7weyP5jR147I)

- Intros, agreement, note taking volunteers and agenda review
- Yaacov: discuss PR merge procedures
  - Link to PR https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4172
  - Yaacov: we need flexibility in the merging policies
  - Yaacov: currently we need two reviews and wait two weeks so interested parties can review it
  - Yaacov: the rule would only be for medium-large PRâ€™s (recommendation)
  - Yaacov: small changes would go along faster
  - Yaacov: purposefully vague about what is small-medium-large, people with merge permissions can have their own opinion.
  - Jovi: I think the main things that need waiting time/more reviews are spec-changes/new features
  - Lenz: will leave comment for getting to non-controversial wording
- Yaacov: how to handle existing discrepancies between main/v17-alpha and v16
  - The main point coming down to, do we keep going the way we do by manually forwardporting or do we use merge commits
  - The clean diff for v15 vs v16 is also not there due to backporting commits going into v16
- Action items
  - Yaacov to check whether there are any mandates from the linux foundation around merge processes
  - Yaacov to double check with the GraphQL JS discord
