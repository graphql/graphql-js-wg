- Intros, agreement, note taking volunteers and agenda review
- Previous meeting action items
  - Updating the typeof process PR https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg/issues/123
  - Cleaning up bundling changes https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg/issues/124
  - Alternative proposal to remove instanceof checks https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg/issues/125
- Proposal: change default branch to 16.x.x (5m, Benjie)
  - Benjie: Main has been the WIP for GraphQL.JS 17 for a while
  - Benjie: Reason for that being incremental delivery being the big release
  - Benjie: Incremental delivery is under active development after a big pivot
  - Benjie: Currently main is still unstable, folks who want to PR fixes are looking at v17 code
  - Benjie: Recommendation: change default branch to 16.x.x
    - Either we create a v17 branch and make main the v16 release
    - Or we leverage the default dropdown to be 16.x.x
  - Benjie: change default branch to 16.x.x
  - Yaacov: scripts and github action could be impacted
  - Benjie: as far as I know they are not - this is a GitHub only setting
  - Benjie: potential impact is the ones that read the PR’s and look at the labels
  - Action item: Saihaj makes changes in GitHub actions
  - Action item: Benjie changes the default branch setting to be 16.x.x
- Recent releases (10m, Benjie)
  - Benjie: spent entire day figuring out releases etc to advance oneOf and others
  - Benjie: there were some issues with the publish scripts probably related to the specific computer they were being run on
  - Benjie: infinite loop in one of the validations that was fixed in v16 - went ahead and merged it
  - Benjie: another fix with async and sync resolvers, Ivan fixed it and it never got shipped
  - Benjie: also added the new recommended validation rules
  - Benjie: in v16 we fixed a lot of things relating to oneOf (printing the schema, showing in the introspection, …)
  - Benjie: added thunk support for enum values to support self-referencing in enum values
  - Benjie: v17 a lot of PR’s by Yaacov and also the oneOf fixes
  - Benjie: shipping now works on all of the branches
- GraphQL.JS maintenance (5m, Jovi)
  - Backporting fixes to GraphQL 17
    - Benjie: wouldn’t worry too much about putting things on a backlog
    - Benjie: forward porting into v17 hopefully shouldn’t be too much of an issue
  - Getting reviews/merges on pull requests
    - Jovi: we can’t ask for reviews without being a member
    - Action item: Benjie to add Jovi as a member so they can ping the graphql-js/reviewers
  - Getting issues closed
    - Jovi: issues for i.e. v16 don’t close when resolved through a PR
    - Benjie: When we change the default branch this will automatically close again
- Stack size depth issue (5m, Jovi)
  - Action item: find real world use cases for this change
