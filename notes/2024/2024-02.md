- Versions are managed via long-lived branches
  - No specific support for old versions, rely on open source interests to raise a PR to backport fixes (then we can publish a release)
- Who can get permissions on NPM to publish?
  - Benjie can get permission
- GitHub actions seems to already have access to publish. Canary publishes and deprecates right away, so will need to revise those if we want to use this to publish major versions.
- ACTION - saihaj, research the GitHub actions to see if we can have it publish
  - https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg/issues/105
- ACTION - yaacov, research what needs to happen before we merge a PR: commit message format, labels, etc.
  - [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/resources/gen-changelog.ts](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/resources/gen-changelog.ts)
- ACTION - benjie, reach out to Ivan and see if the merge/release processes are documented
  - [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  - https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/main/resources/gen-version.ts
- Scripts might be running using Ivan's tokens?
- Lots of teams on GitHub: Reviewers, maintainers, etc - streamline them?
- ACTION - figure out which of the roles are needed
