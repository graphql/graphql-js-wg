# GraphQL WG Notes - May 2024

**Watch the replays:**
[GraphQL.js Working Group Meetings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP1igyLx8foHghwopNuQM7weyP5jR147I)

- [Agenda link](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg/blob/main/agendas/2024/05-May/29-graphql-js-wg-may-2024.md)
- Intros, agreement, etc.
- Agenda item: Call for reviews (Jovi)
  - [Fragment arguments PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4015) - split up into parse/execute/typeInfo
  - [Process.env changes in v16](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4022)
- Agenda item: Collection of libraries and how they import from graphql (Lenz)
  - Considering bundling changes in v17 (discussed in April meeting)
  - Avoiding dual package hazard, release current v17 alpha as v18
  - Benjie noted that he wasn’t sure which exports are guaranteed documented exports
  - We explored which ones are used by the community
  - Changes introduce an exports field - missing file means breaking imports
  - Assumption was that importing from the root would be enough
  - Currently package guarantees that you can import from folders
  - Individual files are not officially guaranteed
  - Issue [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/4074](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/4074)
  - Pinged maintainers and brought up into the GraphQL WG
  - Participating libraries said to be okay with just importing from the root
  - A lot of them import TypeScript types that aren’t really exported
    - Most of them are simple types
  - Jovi: maybe we should leverage GitHub code search to reach out rather than wait for input
  - Phil: we collected a similar import-map for modular-graphql, which brought us to a similar conclusion that only root/folders are used.
  - Phil: biggest concern are libraries that aren’t maintained but still in use, folks have to explicitly indicate that they support graphql v17
  - Phil: [https://github.com/0no-co/babel-plugin-modular-graphql](https://github.com/0no-co/babel-plugin-modular-graphql)
  - Lenz: can import types that are marked internal deeply
  - Phil: the Maybe/Map type shouldn’t be exposed, they are simple and won’t change
  - Suggested path forward: leave issue open and move forward with leaving the folders as an export-map
- Agenda item: Implement bundling changes (Lenz)
  - [Open pull request](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4096)
  - Next week will be ready for review
  - Phil: “module” field isn’t official in the package.json - so I can see why vite and vitest behave differently
  - Lenz: you need different conditions for the types to have `mts` and `ts` because TS will start complaining in the future
  - Lenz: this pattern is established by very popular libraries, seen in Redux-Saga/Emotion/…
  - Phil: not to disqualify the credibility of who apply this pattern - there are a lot of packages that have more downloads and I can’t see everyone applying these changes
  - Phil: in urql and many other libraries we have explored solutions to this. By definition there can still be a dual package hazard as we can have duplicate installations. GraphQL would complain because of the `instanceof` check.
  - Phil: general concern, we are trying to fix libraries that are refusing to fix themselves
  - Lenz: my main concern is that right now it’s impossible to test GraphQL libraries - removing `instance`of is a lot more effort.
- Agenda item: process.env, globalThis, and typeof process (Lenz)
  - This ties into the point above, it would be better served by removing `instanceof` action item for Phil to create a proposal
  -
  - We can fix this in GraphQL 16 so people can upgrade by reverting, using `typeof process` or `globalThis.process`
  - Meeting decision: `globalThis.process`
  - We’ll need accompanying documentation for bundlers, apollo already has this
- Action items are transferred to the wg/issues
