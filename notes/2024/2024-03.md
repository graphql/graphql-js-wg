- [Benjie] GraphQL.js WG - between maintainers now, all help welcome
- Previous WG figured out a lot of what’s involved wrt releases, have a checklist
- `main` branch is v17, incremental delivery being a big part of that, that branch is not release-worthy
- In an interesting state
- No plan yet
- Ideas:
  - Change main branch so that it’s the working branch for v16
  - Unblocks RFC process
  - Then switch back to v17 once it’s closer
- [Jeff] Asks about changesets
- [Benjie] Mooted; we have scripts that accomplish what’s needed re: labeling, tagging, etc.
- Second-hand info from Ivan, et al.
- Helping w/ any of what we outlined - a checklist of things to do for releases (AI for Apollo Client team?)
- Lots of roles right now - that proliferation
- [Fernando] PRs to get some eyes on
  - [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3995](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3995)
  - [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-relay-js/pull/389](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-relay-js/pull/389)
    - Question about Generics, Context
- [Benjie] RE: #3995
  - Personal opinion, not necessarily representing the project
  - Could add overhead to address maybe ESLint being overzealous
  - Keeping projects simple is helpful
