# GraphQL WG Notes - October 2025

**Watch the replays:**
[GraphQL.js Working Group Meetings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP1igyLx8foHghwopNuQM7weyP5jR147I)

- Martin: Next v16 release
  - The reference implementation is behind the GraphQL specification
  - We merged executable descriptions
  - The backport PR for schema-coordinates is open
    - Needs review [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4493](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4493)
- Martin: GraphQL conf being behind us, I want to continue with the onError functionality
  - [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4364](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4364)
  - This is dependent on capabilities getting into GraphQL JS
  - Would be nice to have this in the v16 release but capabilities is the biggest dependency
  - Question from Martin: can we do a release?
  - Jovi: releases are cheap let’s just do two releases
  - Martin: Let’s review schema-coordinates, do a release for spec parity and then do one for capabilties
- Uri: What if we were to rewrite GraphQL JS
  - There’s friction between GraphQL js being the reference implementation
  - The idea is to have another library that is more tailored towards
  - We did this at GraphQL Yoga a few years ago because we wanted to unblock ourselves
  - This introduces room for experimentation
- Lenz: concern about package names
  - It would need to be inside of the @graphql package?
  - Use exports conditions?
- Jovi:
  - Graphql.web is 40x faster (please correct if I didn’t get that correctly)
  - It’s a good idea but we really need to go through Lenz concern
- Lenz
  - We can switch the package name
  - Repurposing is probably best
- Uri
  - This group + Mateo is probably the majority of the people doing GraphQL
  - Apollo + The Guild + Mercurius can cover a lot of ground
  - This coupling is not a great thing
  - We could release more modular: parse, execute, etc…
  - Right now we are all coupled, which makes collaboration harder
- Lenz (in chat)
  - Modular also means more maintainance
- Martin
  - Could we overwrite the old code with the new one so we only get a single copy in the bundle
- Jovi
  - Probably but it creates a lot of coupling/maintainance work
- Yaacov
  - What are the features that are blocked bu the current design?
- Uri
  - This is probably a good start: write a doc about what we want to do
  - Maybe some of them we can do on top of graphql-js
  - Ideas
    - Different execution algorithms
    - Modularity
- Yaacov
  - Is that doable with envelop?
- Uri
  - Yes but it still requires graphql-js
  - Envelop is just for Yoga
- Jovi
  - It’s not just features
  - GraphQL has no opinions on how to execute fields. For an example resolvers as arrays, fragment arguments, doing things like grafast, for an example
- Uri
  - It’s also a signal, we have been saying for many years that graphql-js is to be used for production but it’s not really
  - The reference implementation doesn’t have to be the one we use for production
- Jovi
  - There are definitely a few footguns of using graphql-js in production
- Uri
  - This shouldn’t be a different working group
  - It’s “Javascript working group”
- **Action item**: Update graphql-js reviewers to represent people reviewing/working on the repository
- **Action item**: Uri to write all of his ideas for non-graphql-js in issue(s)/GDoc
