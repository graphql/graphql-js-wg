[GraphQL.js Working Group Meetings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP1igyLx8foHghwopNuQM7weyP5jR147I)

- Discuss optimal JavaScript module design (15m, Jayden).
  - Jayden: full article with “blow-by-blow” is at https://jaydenseric.com/blog/optimal-javascript-module-design
  - Jayden: It is ok to use a single named export, but it’s slightly more optimal to use a default for minification purposes.
  - Jayden: current barrel file use means everything is included when anything is included
  - Denis: might you not get more waterfalls with this approach, especially if we are very strict with one export per file, meaning hundreds of files.
  - Jayden: I have experience doing this with multiple production systems with good time savings
  - Jayden: this is an opportunity now that we are moving to esm to make it actually work for those not using bundlers
  - Benjie: what about discoverability, in terms of finding the functions available?
  - Jayden: you can get the same discoverability not in the import { ... } but in the from ‘/graphql/....’
  - Yaacov: would you want to show us what this would look like in a PR?
  - Jayden: work on this would require kind of locking the code base, because all other PRs would have to rebase, and this PR would be incredibly difficult to merge would
  - Denis: I found a package which actually shows the waterfall, could you comment on whether 140 files over the browser would be a problem, because that’s what I am envisioning, although I cannot be sure whether it would be the same after the refactor.
  - Jayden: demos his web site showing indeed many files, but all the code is used (except react-dom, and things are snappy.
  - Benjie: from chat: jscodeshift may help people upgrade
  - Jayden: action item => create an issue
