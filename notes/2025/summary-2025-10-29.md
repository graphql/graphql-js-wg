The GraphQL working group meeting began with introductions and a presentation on the next V16 release, including discussion of operation descriptions and schema coordinates. The team reviewed the GraphQL specification process and discussed implementing error handling and capability features, with plans to release new features in about a month. The group explored the possibility of creating a new GraphQL implementation outside the reference implementation, discussing various technical considerations and challenges while considering the impact on existing applications and customers.

## Next Steps

- Jovi: Extract the GraphQL.js reviewers list update into an issue after the meeting
- Martin: Review the schema coordinates PR
- Jovi and Yaacov: Make a release of GraphQL.js after schema coordinates PR is merged
- Matteo: Write a document with all ideas and thoughts about alternative GraphQL implementation
- Uri: Open a GitHub issue to brain dump ideas about rewriting GraphQL implementation and link to a Google Doc for collaborative editing
- Jovi: Talk to Benjie about the GraphQL.js reviewer list and create an issue assigned to himself

## Summary

### GraphQL V16 Release Discussion

The GraphQL working group meeting began with introductions from Jovi, Martin, Uri, and Yaacov. Martin presented on the next V16 release, discussing two key points: operation descriptions, which Jovi had implemented in PR #4494, and PR #4493 regarding schema coordinates. Martin inquired about any potential blockers for merging PR #4493, but the discussion was cut short due to technical difficulties.

### GraphQL Review and Feature Planning

The team discussed the GraphQL specification review process, noting that the current reviewer list might be outdated. Jovi agreed to create an issue to update the reviewer list, which Martin and Lenz supported. They also discussed the timeline for implementing error handling and capability features, with Martin expressing interest in moving forward with error handling once the capability work is complete. The team considered releasing new features in about a month, pending the completion of the capability work.

### GraphQL Implementation Experimentation Discussion

The team discussed creating a new GraphQL implementation outside the reference implementation to allow for faster experimentation and innovation. Uri explained that while GraphQL.js serves as a reference implementation, other projects like Apollo Server and Mercurius have similar goals, but are hindered by the current structure. Lenz raised a concern about creating a second package, as it could lead to both packages being shipped in parallel, potentially causing confusion and making it difficult to pass things between implementations. The team considered using export conditions or import statements to address this issue.

### GraphQL Implementation Challenges Discussed

The team discussed concerns about creating a new GraphQL implementation alongside the existing one, with Lenz emphasizing the importance of the GraphQL package name and the challenges of managing dual implementations. Uri and Martin agreed that while modularizing GraphQL could offer benefits, it would also increase maintenance complexity. The group explored the possibility of breaking down the monolithic GraphQL package into smaller, more replaceable modules, which could allow for more independent development and easier issue resolution.

### GraphQL Implementation Replacement Discussion

The team discussed replacing GraphQL with a new implementation, with Martin and Jovi exploring the possibility of overwriting the existing GraphQL functions with a new version while maintaining compatibility. Uri suggested coordinating the release of this new implementation with major versions of related frameworks like Apollo Server and Yoga, and mentioned the upcoming Node.js LTS version to potentially leverage ESM support. The discussion also touched on the need to consider the transition impact on existing applications and customers.

### GraphQL.js Design and Improvements

Uri discussed the current GraphQL.js design and mentioned the need to compile a list of ideas and features that could be implemented on top of it. He suggested creating a document or database to gather these ideas, emphasizing the library's modularity and the ability to experiment with different execution algorithms. Uri also acknowledged having numerous ideas for potential improvements, which he plans to consolidate.

### GraphQL Implementation Discussion

The group discussed the limitations of GraphQL.js and the need for experimentation with alternative implementations. Uri suggested creating a new reference implementation that could serve as a signal to the community about production-ready libraries. Jovi agreed and mentioned the importance of security in production libraries. Martin suggested that Uri write down his ideas in a GitHub issue, possibly with a label. Jovi offered to create an issue and assign it to himself. The conversation ended with Jovi agreeing to take on the action item to talk to Benjie about the GraphQL GS reviewer.
